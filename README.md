# recipe-app

<p>This project focuses on creating a web application using the Django framework. Working with Python-based Django, I will develop a full-stack web application using the Django development server.<br>
<br>
I will then deploy the application using Heroku, with a Postgres database at the backend, HTML, and CSS-based rendered pages at the frontend and Python-based Django as my web application framework.</p>
